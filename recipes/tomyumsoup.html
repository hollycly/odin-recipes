    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Khmer the word machu means &ldquo;sour&rdquo; and the word salaw means &ldquo;soup&rdquo;. Thus, this soup is also called &ldquo;Salaw machu&rdquo;. The soup is a mix of sweet, sour, and&#8212;maybe&#8212;spicy, if you so choose. The aromaticity of the soup can be attributed to a mix of kaffir lime leaves, galangal and lemongrass.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h4>Tip</h4>
            <p>&ldquo;I like to peel my shrimp but keep the head and tail on for extra flavor. But, it makes it easier when you are peeling and enjoying the shrimp. The great thing about this soup is that you can adjust the spices and seasoning. If you like it a little sweeter, add more sweetener. If you like it more spicy or sour, add those spices in. It's up to you!&rdquo; - Peter Duong.</p>
